            <p>Hi! I'm Lance Lorenzo and I am from Laguna, Philippines, I love reading and puzzles. I am currently
                studying
                Software Development in BYU Pathway Worldwide. I am excited to learn more about coding in general. I
                hope
                that one day I can use this skills in helping hasten the work of the Lord on Earth.</p>

            <p>Fun fact about me is that I really love learning especially when there are hands-on-guidance from someone
                more knowledgeable. I realized this when I served as a full-time missionary in the Philippines Cauayan
                Mission.</p>

            <p>Currently I am serving in my stake as a Stake Young Single Adult Representative. Being entrusted by the Lord with this calling is a both a blessing and a fear of mine, as I do not have much confidence in my skills to lead. I have always believed that I am better off following somebody else and that this are for the more talented people, but I am reminded by the many prophets in the scriptures that the Lord doesn't call the perfect, He calls the willing.</p>

            <p>"Whom the Lord calls, He qualifies.</p>
